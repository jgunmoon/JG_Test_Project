> The corresponding CR for Rel-19 and TS38.214 in R1-2601679 is endorsed.
> | Impacted spec(s): TS38.213 |
> | Reason for change: The agreement reached in RAN1#119 has not been incorporated into the current 213 (V19.1.0). This modification is necessary because the Rel-19 Type-I SP codebook exhibits significant overhead variation across different measured ranks. Specifically, RANK 7/8 yields the maximum overhead for Scheme-A, whereas RANK 4 for Scheme-B. However, according to the current spec, UE shall determine PUCCH resources under the assumption of feedback rank 1 for each CSI report. This approach is based on observations that the Rel-15 Type-I codebook maintains consistent overhead across ranks. Persisting with rank 1 assumption for Rel-19 Type-I codebook CSI reports will inevitably increase the frequency of UCI dropping incidents. |
> | Summary of the change: Change the rank assumption for determination of the PUCCH resource or the number of PRBs or number of part 2 CSI reports. |

If csi-ReportMode of CSI reports is set to 'Mode2', the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each CRI in the CSI report is associated with a resource pair. If the UE is provided CSI-ReportConfig that includes valueOfM, the UE determines a PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource, or a number of Part 2 CSI reports, assuming that each CSI sub-report corresponding to each of M CRIs indicates rank 1. If the UE is provided CSI-ReportConfig that includes a codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel-r19', the UE determines a PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource, or a number of Part 2 CSI reports, assuming that the CSI report, or, if applicable, each CSI sub-report of the CSI report indicates rank 8 if codebookMode set to 'modeA' and typeI-SinglePanelRI-Restriction for the CSI report includes an allowed RI of rank 5, 6, 7 or 8, indicates rank 4 if codebookMode set to 'modeB', and indicates rank 1 otherwise. <Unchanged parts are omitted> =====================End of Text Proposal to TS 38.213================== |

**Agreement** · `8.2` Maintenance on NR MIMO Phase 5 · `RAN1#123:8.2:004`

> Adopt the following changes in Clause 6 of TS38.214:
> For  the remaining of this clause, unless otherwise stated, reference to PUSCH with aperiodic CSI reports includes a PUSCH with UE initiated report when reportTransmissionMode is configured as ‘ModeA’ in the CSI report configuration (as defined in Section 5.2.1.5.4.1).
> - Reason for change:  From the excerpt from 38.214, there is no description on how the UE would transmit the CSI report associated with event driven reporting, regarding mode-B. The understanding in RAN1 is that the same procedure as for aperiodic CSI reports would be used.
> - Summary of change: The UE behavior of UEI CSI reporting when reportTransmissionMode is configured as ‘ModeA’ in the CSI report configuration is to reuse that for PUSCH with aperiodic CSI reports, unless otherwise stated.
> - Consequences if not approved: UE initiated CSI report procedure when reportTransmissionMode is configured as ‘ModeA’ in the CSI report configuration is unclear.

**Agreement** · `8.2.1` Enhancements for UE-initiated/event-driven beam management · `RAN1#122:8.2.1:003`

> Adopt the following changes in Clause 5.2.5 in TS38.214.
> - Reason for change: Reusing the intra-UE multiplexing/prioritization rules of PUSCH with SP-CSI for PUSCH for UEI-BR for Mode B was agreed. However, it is not captured in the current specification on the priority rules of CSI reports.
> - Summary of change: In TS38.214 section 5.2.5, clarify the intra-UE multiplexing/prioritization rules of PUSCH with SP-CSI for PUSCH is reused for UEI-BR for Mode B.
> - Consequences if not approved: UE behavior is not clear when PUSCH carrying UEI-BR for Mode B overlaps with other PUSCHs.
> | 5.2.5 Priority rules for CSI reports <Unchanged parts are omitted> If a UE would transmit a first PUSCH that includes semi-persistent CSI reports or UE initiated CSI report for mode B and a second PUSCH that includes an UL-SCH on the same carrier, and the first PUSCH transmission would overlap in time with the second PUSCH transmission, the UE does not transmit the first PUSCH and transmits the second PUSCH. The UE expects that the first and second PUSCH transmissions satisfy the above timing conditions for PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time when at least one of the first or second PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE. |

> Adopt the following TP for TS38.214 in principle
> | Reason for change: nCSI_ref is determined based on the number of CSI-RS/SSB resources. For L1-CLI-RSSI report, the CLI is measured based on the CLI-RSSI resource rather than CSI-RS/SSB resources. The existing rule for nCSI_ref determination is not applicable for L1 CLI-RSSI report. Summary of change: Clarify nCSI_ref for L1-CLI-RSSI report as follows: If a single CLI-RSSI measurement resource is configured for interference measurement, nCSI_ref is the smallest value greater than or equal to , such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot. If multiple CLI-RSSI measurement resources are configured for interference measurement, nCSI_ref is the smallest value greater than or equal to , such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot. Consequences if not approved: UE behavior for nCSI_ref determination of LI-CLI-RSSI report is unclear. |
> | 5.2.2.5 CSI reference resource definition The CSI reference resource for a serving cell is defined as follows: - In the frequency domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by the group of downlink physical resource blocks corresponding to the band to which the derived CSI relates. - In the time domain, the CSI reference resource for a CSI reporting in uplink slot n', or a CSI reporting in an OCC group starting in uplink slot n' if OCC is enabled, is defined by a single downlink slot , where is a parameter configured by higher layer as specified in clause 4.2 of [6, TS 38.213], and where is the subcarrier spacing configuration for with a value of 0 for frequency range 1 and for FR2-NTN, - where and and are the subcarrier spacing configurations for DL and UL, respectively, and and are determined by higher-layer configured ca-SlotOffset for the cells transmitting the uplink and downlink, as defined in clause 4.5 of [4, TS 38.211] - where for periodic and semi-persistent CSI reporting or for periodic CLI RSSI reporting - if a single CSI-RS/SSB resource is configured for channel measurement or if a single CLI-RSSI measurement resource is configured for interference measurement, nCSI_ref is the smallest value greater than or equal to , such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot, or - if multiple CSI-RS/SSB resources are configured for channel measurement or if multiple CLI-RSSI measurement resources are configured for interference measurement, nCSI_ref is the smallest value greater than or equal to , such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot. If a CSI-ReportConfig is configured with the higher layer parameter codebookType set to 'typeI-SinglePanel-r19', with total number of CSI-RS ports , for capability 2, as reported by UE capability indication, nCSI_ref is the smallest value greater than or equal to , such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot. |

> Adopt the following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a in principle
> | Reason for change: | Clause 5.2.4a specifies early CSI acquisition for both LTM and L3 handover. In the first paragraph, "candidate cell" is used for LTM and "target cell" is used for handover. However, in the remaining part of the clause, the CSI-IM association, the number of NZP-CSI-RS resources for channel measurement, and the PUSCH used for the CSI report are described only for a candidate cell, although the same procedures apply to the target cell for handover. |
> |  |  |
> | Summary of change: | In clause 5.2.4a, "or the target cell" is added where only "candidate cell" is used, so that the early CSI reporting procedure applies to both LTM and handover. |
> |  |  |
> | Consequences if not approved: | The early CSI reporting procedure for handover is not fully specified in clause 5.2.4a, since the CSI-IM association and the PUSCH for the CSI report are described only for a candidate cell. This may lead to ambiguous or incorrect implementation of early CSI reporting for handover. |
> | ==============First change============== 5.2.4a CSI Reporting for LTM and handover A UE configured with LTM-Config can be provided configurations for CSI acquisition, by up to one Reporting Setting, ltm-CSI-ReportConfig, for a candidate cell. A UE can be provided configuration for CSI acquisition, by one Reporting Setting, earlyCSI-Acquisition in ReconfigurationWithSync, for a target cell. Each Reporting Setting ltm-CSI-ReportConfig or earlyCSI-Acquisition is associated with either one or two Resource Settings - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement or early-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet) is configured, it provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for both channel and interference measurements. The UE is not expected to be configured with more than 128 NZP CSI-RS ports in the CSI-RS resource set contained within the Resource Setting. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement or early-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet) provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement, and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourceForInterferenceMeasurements or early-CSI-IM-ResourceSet), provides a list of CSI-IM resources for interference measurement. The UE is not expected to be configured with more than 128 NZP CSI-RS ports in the CSI-RS resource set contained within the Resource Setting. The Resource Setting given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement, LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig, contains configuration of a LTM-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet which comprises of a list of Z ≥ 1 NZP CSI-RS resource indices (given by ltm-CSI-RS-ResourceList) and a list of Z LTM-CandidateIds (given by ltm-CandidateIdList) referring to candidate cells associated with the NZP CSI-RS resource indices. For CSI acquisition associated with a Reporting Setting, ltm-CSI-ReportConfig, the UE is expected to measure the NZP-CSI-RS resources in ltm-CSI-RS-ResourceList associated with the LTM-CandidateId that is equal to the LTM-CandidateId of the LTM-Candidate under which the Reporting Setting is configured. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM, each NZP-CSI-RS resource the UE is expected to measure for channel measurement for a candidate cell is resource-wise associated with a CSI-IM resource for the same candidate cell by the ordering of the NZP-CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources in the corresponding resource sets. The number of NZP-CSI-RS resources the UE is expected to measure for channel measurement for a candidate cell equals to the number of CSI-IM resources for interference measurement. The UE shall expect the following configuration provided by ltm-CSI-ReportConfig or earlyCSI-Acquisition: - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the CQI format indicator is Wideband CQI. - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the PMI format indicator is Wideband PMI. - The codebook type is typeI-SinglePanel. - The reportQuantity is set to ‘cri-RI-PMI-CQI’. After a UE receives an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, TS 38.321] providing a candidate cell (given by Target Configuration ID field), and a ltm-CSI-ReportConfig is configured for the candidate cell, the UE can measure corresponding NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources if configured/activated, and shall transmit a CSI report to the candidate cell. After a UE receives a ReconfigurationWithSync configured with earlyCSI-Acquisition, the UE can measure corresponding NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources if configured/activated, and shall transmit a CSI report to the target cell. For RACH-less LTM cell switch or RACH-less handover [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant [6, TS 38.213]. For RACH-based LTM cell switch or RACH-based handover using a contention-free random access procedure [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the PUSCH scheduled by the RAR UL grant or MsgA PUSCH. For RACH-based LTM cell switch or RACH-based handover using a contention-based random access procedure [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant after the HARQ-ACK transmission having ACK value corresponding to PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH transmission addressed to the C-RNTI that is received in response to MSG A, or the first PUSCH scheduled by a PDCCH transmission addressed to the C-RNTI, received in response to Msg3 or MsgA. For the PUSCH determined for CSI reporting, when the UE applies PUSCH repetition Type A or Type B, the CSI report is transmitted only on the first repetition for PUSCH repetition Type A, or on the first actual repetition for PUSCH repetition Type B. If a valid CSI is not available, the UE shall transmit a CSI report which contains a CQI corresponding to the lowest CQI index. Depending on the UE capability, the UE may measure NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources if configured/activated corresponding to a ltm-CSI-ReportConfig before receiving the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, TS 38.321]. ==============End of change============== |

> Adopt the following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a
> | Reason for change | For LTM, ‘ltm-CandidateConfig’ includes an RRCReconfiguration message that is used to provide an LTM candidate configuration, where the RRCReconfiguration message includes a ‘CellGroupConfig’ containing a ‘ReconfigurationWithSync’ that carries a ‘newUE-Identity’ to indicate a RNTI value for UE applied in target cell. For L3 handover, such ‘newUE-Identity’ is also provided for UE through handover command ‘ReconfigurationWithSync’. Thus, for 2-step CBRA based LTM or handover, UE always carries the C-RNTI in MSG A. Based on the above considerations and the CR (R1-2603427) already agreed in RAN1#124bis meeting, the wording “MSG B or” in clause 5.2.4a of TS 38.214-j30 should be removed. The reason is that for the determination of first PUSCH for early CSI report in 2-step CBRA based LTM or handover, the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant after the HARQ-ACK transmission corresponding to “PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH transmission addressed to the C-RNTI that is received in response to MSG A”, rather than referencing “MSG B”. |
> | Summary of change | Remove “MSG B or” from the following paragraph in clause 5.2.4a of TS 38.214-j30 with updates based on the endorsed CR (R1-2603427). |
> | Consequences if not approved | The UE behavior on determining UL resource of early CSI report when C-RNTI has been included in MSG A for CBRA based LTM or handover scenario is incorrect. |
> | Clauses affected | 5.2.4a |
> | 5.2.4a CSI Reporting for LTM and handover *** Unchanged parts are omitted *** For RACH-less LTM cell switch or RACH-less handover [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant [6, TS 38.213]. For RACH-based LTM cell switch or RACH-based handover using a contention-free random access procedure [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the PUSCH scheduled by the RAR UL grant or MsgA PUSCH.

> Adopt the following TPs for TS38.214.
> | 5.2.2.5 CSI reference resource definition *** Unchanged parts are omitted *** If configured to report CQI index, in the CSI reference resource, the UE shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving the CQI index, and if also configured, for deriving PMI and RI: The first 2 OFDM symbols are occupied by control signaling. The number of PDSCH and DM-RS symbols is equal to 12. The same bandwidth part subcarrier spacing configured as for the PDSCH reception The bandwidth as configured for the corresponding CQI report If a UE is configured with SBFD symbols and a CSI-ReportConfig with the higher layer parameter symbolType indicating SBFD symbols, CQI is generated based on the PRBs in the configured CSI report bandwidth that are both in the active DL BWP and in the DL sub-band(s). The IAB-MT shall only assume the frequency resources as indicated by the DL TX power adjustment MAC CE, if indicated for the slot of the CSI reference resource by DL Tx Power Adjustment MAC CE as described in [10, TS 38.321]. *** Unchanged parts are omitted *** |
> | Reason for change In the definition of the hypothetical PDSCH used in calculating the CQI report, the frequency resources are determined by the configured bandwidth for CQI reporting. In SBFD slots, the definition of the frequency resources needs to be clarified to correspond to only usable DL PRBs within the configured reporting bandwidth. Summary of change When UE is configured with CSI report indicating symbolType as SBFD, the CQI is calculated based on the valid DL PRBs in the reporting bandwidth. |

> - Adopt the following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a
> | Reason for change: In existing specification, for early CSI acquisition during RACH-based HO with CBRA, the current 2-step RA relies on “after MsgB HARQ-ACK”, which does not cover the MsgA success path via C-RNTI addressed PDCCH UL grant, and it also does not exclude the NACK case. Summary of change: Update TS 38.214 to clarify that ACK value is required for the MsgB HARQ-ACK and allow the first PUSCH to be the one scheduled by a C-RNTI addressed PDCCH received in response to MsgA. Consequences if not approved: Early CSI acquisition for 2-step RA HO may be missing in the MsgA UL-grant success path and may be triggered after a NACK, leading to inconsistent UE behavior and potential performance/interoperability issues. |

Supports two HARQ-ACK codebooks with different priorities to be simultaneously constructed with the restriction up to one sub-slot based HARQ-ACK codebook. 2. Supports separate PUCCH configuration for different HARQ-ACK codebooks. 3. Supports 2-level priority of HARQ-ACK for dynamically scheduled PDSCH and SPS PDSCH. 4. Supports a DCI format 1_3 scheduling PDSCH with different HARQ-ACK priorities when only DCI format 0_3/1_3 is configured per BWP. 5. Supports separate configuration of parameters PDSCH-HARQ-ACK-Codebook, UCI-OnPUSCH and 'codeBlockGroupTransmission" for different HARQ-ACK codebooks. 6. Supported maximum number of actual PUCCH transmissions for HARQ-ACK within a slot Candidate values for the component 6 of this FG is: For NCP, {4, 5, 6, 7} for 2-symbol*7 sub-slot configuration; For ECP, the candidate value is {4,5,6} for 2-symbol*6 sub-slot configuration 7.

If a UE reports this FG but not 11-3, it can only support two slot-based HARQ-ACK codebooks. The number of PUCCHs for CSI reporting per slot is not impacted compared with Rel-15 by introducing the new HARQ-ACK CBs Component 6 is applied to the sub-slot HARQ-ACK codebook. It is assumed that only 1 actual PUCCH transmission for HARQ-ACK within a slot for slot-based HARQ-ACK codebook. Component 6 is reported for 2-symbol*7 sub-slot configuration. For 7-symbol*2 sub-slot configuration, the value of component 6 is {2} for both NCP and ECP cases. For component 6, maximum of 1 actual PUCCH transmission for HARQ-ACK within a slot for slot-based HARQ-ACK codebook. Thus value reported for component 6 has no meaning for "slot-based + slot based". For component 6, same values as for FG11-4 are reported (if the UE also report FG11-4) | Optional with capability signaling |

For each candidate cell, the UE determines the time domain behavior of a SS/PBCH block from ssb-Periodicity and ssb-PositionsInBurst and the frequency domain behavior of a SS/PBCH block is determined by the higher layer parameters subcarrierSpacing, ssb-Frequency. - A ltm-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet comprises of a list of Z ≥ 1 NZP CSI-RS resource indices (given by ltm- CSI-RS-ResourceList) and a list of Z LTM-CandidateIds (given by ltm-CandidateIdList) referring to candidate cells associated with the NZP CSI-RS resource indices. The UE shall expect that the NZP CSI-RS resources in ltm-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet are configured with the higher layer parameter repetition set to ‘off’ when LTM-ReportContent configured within the LTM-CSI-ReportConfig associated with the LTM CSI Resource Setting is set to ‘cri-RSRP’.

Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of [10, TS 38.321], which selects one of the semi-persistent reporting settings for use by the UE on the PUCCH. For a selected reporting setting for which the CSI-ReportConfig contains a list of sub-configurations provided by the higher layer parameter csi-ReportSubConfigToAddModList, the activation command can also select one or more sub-configurations to use by the UE as described in clause 6.1.3.X of [10, TS 38.321]. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot n corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting from the first slot that is after slot  where  is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

> | 4.1 Power allocation for downlink The gNB determines the downlink transmit EPRE. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant across the bandwidth. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE is constant over SSS carried in different SS/PBCH blocks. For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume that the ratio of SSS EPRE to PBCH DM-RS EPRE is 0 dB. For the purpose of CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink EPRE of a port of CSI-RS resource configuration is constant across the configured downlink bandwidth and constant across all configured OFDM symbols. The downlink SS/PBCH SSS EPRE can be derived from the SS/PBCH downlink transmit power given by the parameter ss-PBCH-BlockPower provided by higher layers or od-ss-PBCH-BlockPower provided in od-ssb-config for SS/PBCH block transmitted according to Clause 4.4 of [6, TS 38.213]. The downlink SSS transmit power is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in [W]) of all resource elements that carry the SSS within the operating system bandwidth.

> Following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a is endorsed in principle.
> - Reason for change: Current texts in the referred paragraph in TS 38.214 create some ambiguity. First, “corresponding NZP CSI-RS resources” is unclear. It presents unclear meaning of what the NZP CSI-RS resources are corresponding to. In our views, we should instead describe that NZP CSI-RS resources are corresponding to a [ltm-eCSI-ReportConfig].

> Following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a is endorsed in principle.
> | 5.2.4a CSI Reporting for LTM <omitted text> A UE configured with LTM-Config can be provided configurations for CSI acquisition, by up to one Reporting Setting, [ltm-eCSI-ReportConfig], for a candidate cell. Each Reporting Setting [ltm-eCSI-ReportConfig] is associated with either one or two Resource Settings - When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, it provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for both channel and interference measurements. The UE is not expected to be configured with more than 128 NZP CSI-RS ports in the CSI-RS resource set contained within the Resource Setting. - When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement) provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement, and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter [ltm-ResourceForInterferenceMeasurements]), provides a list of [CSI-IM resources] for interference measurement. The UE shall expect the following configuration provided [ltm-eCSI-ReportConfig]: - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the CQI format indicator is Wideband CQI. - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the PMI format indicator is Wideband PMI. - The codebook type is typeI-SinglePanel. - The reportQuantity is set to ‘cri-RI-PMI-CQI’. <omitted text> |
