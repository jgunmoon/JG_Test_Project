(2) The text describing the determination of PL offset value for the case “if followUnifiedTCI-StateSRS is not provided for a SRS resource set…” is ambiguous. For example, regarding “when TCI-State or a TCI-UL-State includes pl-Offset”: it is not clear which of the TCI state or TCI-UL-State includes the pl-Offset.

**Agreement** · `8.2.1` Enhancements for UE-initiated/event-driven beam management · `RAN1#122:8.2.1:002`

> Adopt the following changes in TS38.213 Section 7.5:
> - Reason for change: When the transmission powers of multiple uplink transmissions exceed the UE’s maximum transmit power, TS 38.213 specifies a prioritization mechanism to determine which transmissions should be reduced or dropped. This prioritization covers all conventional UCI types, such as SR, CSI reports, and HARQ-ACK, ensuring consistent behavior across implementations when power reduction is needed. However, the UE-initiated CSI reporting indicator (UEIRI), introduced as a new UCI type to support UE-initiated CSI reporting, is not currently included in the priority order defined in TS 38.213.
> - Summary of change: Capture the priority rule for UEIRI, i.e., the same priority as LRR/SR.
> - Consequences if not approved: Without explicit prioritization, UE behavior may vary between implementations, potentially causing inconsistent reporting of UE-initiated CSI under power-limited conditions. This could result in the unintended suppression of UEIRI or, conversely, excessive reduction of other UCI types, impacting system performance and interoperability
> | 7.5 Prioritizations for transmission power reductions For single cell operation with two uplink carriers or for operation with carrier aggregation or for operation with a candidate cell configured by LTM-Config or for operation with a single cell configured with sTx-2Panel, if a total UE transmit power for PUSCH or PUCCH or PRACH or SRS transmissions on serving cell(s) or on a candidate cell, if any, in a frequency range in a respective transmission occasion would exceed , where is the linear value of in transmission occasion as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] for FR1 and [8-2, TS 38.101-2] for FR2, the UE allocates power to PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH/SRS transmissions according to the following priority order (in descending order) so that the total UE transmit power for transmissions on serving cell(s) or on a candidate cell, if any, in the frequency range is smaller than or equal to for that frequency range in every symbol of transmission occasion . If the UE transmits SRS on multiple SRS resources according to Clause 6.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214], the UE allocates power so that all REs of the SRS transmission have same power. For the purpose of power allocation in this clause, if a UE is provided uci-MuxWithDiffPrio and the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH, a priority index of the PUSCH is the larger of (a) the priority index of the PUSCH according to clause 9 and (b) the larger priority index of the HARQ-ACK information. When determining a total transmit power for serving cells or a candidate cell, if any, as described in Clause 21 in a frequency range in a symbol of transmission occasion , the UE does not include power for transmissions starting after the symbol of transmission occasion . The total UE transmit power in a symbol of a slot is defined as the sum of the linear values of UE transmit powers for PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS in the symbol of the slot. - PRACH transmission on a candidate cell, if any, as described in Clause 21 - PRACH transmission on the PCell - PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with larger priority index - For PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with same priority index - PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, and/or SR, and/or LRR, and/or UEIRI, or PUSCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information of the priority index - PUCCH transmission with CSI or PUSCH transmission with CSI - PUSCH transmission without HARQ-ACK information of the priority index or CSI and, for Type-2 random access procedure, PUSCH transmission on the PCell - If the UE is configured with prioSCellPRACH-OverSP-PeriodicSRS-r17 - Aperiodic SRS transmission or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other than the PCell - Semi-persistent and/or periodic SRS transmission - otherwise, - SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than semi-persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving cell other than the PCell =========unchanged omitted=========== |

> For Rel-19 SRS port grouping, whether resources across multiple resource sets can be used follows the legacy principle, i.e. for periodic and semi-persistent SRS resource sets, it is not possible to have the grouped SRS ports resources across multiple SRS resource sets; but for aperiodic SRS resource sets, the grouped SRS ports can come from multiple SRS resource sets.

> Adopt the following TP to TS 38.214 clause 5.1.5 in principle:
> | Reason for change: | RAN1 agreements supported Type C (and Type D if applicable) as the QCL type for WUS in RRC_CONNECTED mode, which is applicable when unified TCI framework is configured. TS 38.213 correctly reflected the agreements, while TS 38.214 is not consistent with TS 38.213 and the agreements. Also, several occasions with unified TCI framework also need to be clarified to be applicable to WUS. |
> |  |  |
> | Summary of change: | When applying the unified TCI framework, separate description for WUS to use Type C QCL type is added. |
> |  |  |
> | Consequences if not approved: | The UE behaviour in TS 38.214 is not consistent with TS 38.213 or the RAN1 agreements. |
> | =============================== Start of TP================================ 5.1.5 Antenna ports quasi co-location The UE can be configured with a list of up to M TCI-State configurations within the higher layer parameter PDSCH-Config to decode PDSCH according to a detected PDCCH with DCI intended for the UE and the given serving cell, where M depends on the UE capability maxNumberConfiguredTCIstatesPerCC. Each TCI-State contains parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type1 for the first DL RS, and qcl-Type2 for the second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter qcl-Type in QCL-Info and may take one of the following values: - 'typeA': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread} - 'typeB': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread} - 'typeC': {Doppler shift, average delay} - 'typeD': {Spatial Rx parameter} The UE can be configured with a list of up to 128 TCI-State configurations, within the higher layer parameter dl-OrJointTCI-StateList in PDSCH-Config for providing a reference signal for the quasi co-location for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH in a BWP/CC, for CSI-RS, and to provide a reference signal with qcl-Type set to 'typeD', if applicable, for determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a BWP/CC, and SRS. If the TCI-State or TCI-UL-State configurations are absent in a BWP of the CC, the UE can apply the TCI-State or TCI-UL-State configurations from a reference BWP of a reference CC configured by unifiedTCI-StateRef. The UE is not expected to be configured with tci-StatesToAddModList, SpatialRelationInfo or PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo, except SpatialRelationInfoPos in a CC in a band, if the UE is configured with dl-OrJointTCI-StateList or ul-TCI-StateList in any CC in the same band. The UE can assume that when the UE is configured with tci-StatesToAddModList in any CC in the CC list configured by simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1-r16, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2-r16, simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1-r16, or simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2-r16, the UE is not configured with dl-OrJointTCI-StateList or ul-TCI-StateList in any CC within the same band in the CC list. The UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 of [10, TS 38.321], or 6.1.3.47 of [10, TS 38.321], used to map up to 8 TCI states and/or pairs of TCI states, with one TCI state for DL channels/signals and/or one TCI state for UL channels/signals to the codepoints of the DCI field 'Transmission Configuration Indication' for one or for a set of CCs/DL BWPs. When a set of TCI state IDs are activated for a set of CCs/DL BWPs and if applicable, for a set of CCs/UL BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs is determined by the indicated CC in the activation command, the same set of TCI state IDs are applied for all DL and/or UL BWPs in the indicated CCs. If the activation command maps TCI-State(s) and/or TCI-UL-State(s) to only one TCI codepoint, the UE shall apply the indicated TCI-State(s) and/or TCI-UL-State(s) to one or to a set of CCs /DL BWPs, and if applicable, to one or to a set of CCs /UL BWPs once the indicated mapping for the one single TCI codepoint is applied as described in [11, TS 38.133]. When the bwp-id or cell for QCL-TypeA/D source RS in a QCL-Info of the TCI state is not configured, the UE assumes that QCL-TypeA/D source RS is configured in the CC/DL BWP where TCI state applies. When tci-PresentInDCI is set as 'enabled' or tci-PresentDCI-1-2 is configured for the CORESET, a UE configured with dl-OrJointTCI-StateList with activated TCI-State or ul-TCI-StateList with activated TCI-UL-State receives DCI format 1_1/1_2/1_3 providing indicated TCI-State(s) and/or TCI-UL-State(s) for a CC or all CCs in the same CC list configured by simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1-r17, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2-r17, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3-r17, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4-r17. The DCI format 1_3 provides indicated TCI state(s) and/or TCI-UL-State(s) for the CC(s) in a scheduledCellListDCI-1-3 if the UE is scheduled by the DCI format 1_3 to receive PDSCH at least on one serving cell in the scheduledCellListDCI-1-3. The DCI format 1_1/1_2 can be with or without, if applicable, DL assignment. If the DCI format 1_1/1_2 is without DL assignment, the UE can assume the following: - CS-RNTI is used to scramble the CRC for the DCI - The values of the following DCI fields are set as follows: - RV = all '1's - MCS = all '1's - NDI = 0 - Set to all '0's for FDRA Type 0, or all '1's for FDRA Type 1, or all '0's for dynamicSwitch (same as in Table 10.2-4 of [6, TS 38.213]). After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where more than one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state and before application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states: - The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH that are not received during the RACH procedure, and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the reference signal(s) in the CandidateTCI-State indicated in the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, 38.321] if applicable. - The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the reference signal in the determined CandidateTCI-State for RACH-less conditional LTM cell switch [10, 38.321] if applicable. - The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the random access procedure initiated by RACH-based conditional LTM cell switch if applicable. - Otherwise, the UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the initial access procedure with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'. . After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where more than one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state or an initial higher layer configuration of ul-TCI-StateList where more than one TCI-UL-State can be used as an indicated TCI state and before application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states: - The UE determines the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant based PUSCH that is not transmitted during the RACH procedure and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH that are not transmitted during the RACH procedure, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, from the CandidateTCI-State or CandidateTCI-UL-State indicated in the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, 38.321] if applicable. - The UE determines the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, from the determined CandidateTCI-State or CandidateTCI-UL-State for RACH-less conditional LTM cell switch [10, 38.321] if applicable. - The UE determines the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a MsgA PUSCH transmission during the random access procedure initiated by RACH-based conditional LTM cell switch [10, 38.321] if applicable. - Otherwise, the UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a MsgA PUSCH transmission during the initial access procedure. After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where more than one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state as part of a Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] and before applying an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states: - The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI-RS applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeA', and when applicable, also with respect to qcl-Type set to 'typeD'. After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where more than one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state or a higher layer configuration of ul-TCI-StateList where more than one TCI-UL-State can be used as an indicated TCI state as part of a Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331] and before applying an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states: - The UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a MsgA PUSCH transmission during random access procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in [12, TS 38.331]. If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where only one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state, the UE obtains the QCL assumptions from that TCI state for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI -RS applying the indicated TCI state. If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of dl-OrJointTCI-StateList where only one TCI-State can be used as an indicated TCI state or a higher layer configuration of ul-TCI-StateList where only one TCI-UL-State can be used as an indicated TCI state, the UE determines an UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, from that TCI state for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and SRS applying the indicated TCI state. ============================= Unchanged Text Omitted ============================ ============================= End of TP |

> For study on DL/UL reciprocity based PUSCH transmission for 6GR, further consider the following schemes only:
> - Scheme 1. CSI-RS based DL channel estimation by UE, UE calculates UL precoder, UE transmits (precoded) SRS, and NW indicates UE precoder information to schedule (e.g., analogous with non-codebook based PUSCH in NR)
>   - Companies report the assumption of precoded SRS (e.g., detail SRS configuration, precoder for SRS)

> | Reason for change: The slot configuration for on demand SIB1 is unclear due to missing IE sib1-tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. Summary of change: Add missing IE sib1-tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for slot configuration for on demand SIB1. The SSB symbols indicated by OD-SIB1-Config cannot be indicated as uplink by sib1-tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and the PRACH symbols indicated by OD-SIB1-Config cannot be indicated as downlink by sib1-tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. Consequence if not approved: Ambiguity occurs for the slot configuration for on demand SIB1. 11.1 Slot configuration A slot format includes downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols. The following are applicable for each serving cell. If a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, the UE sets the slot format per slot over a number of slots as indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. The tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon provides - a reference SCS configuration by referenceSubcarrierSpacing - a pattern1. The pattern1 provides - a slot configuration period of msec by dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity - a number of slots with only downlink symbols by nrofDownlinkSlots - a number of downlink symbols by nrofDownlinkSymbols - a number of slots with only uplink symbols by nrofUplinkSlots - a number of uplink symbols by nrofUplinkSymbols A value msec is valid only for , . A value msec is valid only for , . A value msec is valid only for,. A value msec is valid only for , or . A slot configuration period of msec includes slots with SCS configuration . From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last slots include only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink symbols. The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining are flexible symbols. The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame. If tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon provides both pattern1 and pattern2, the UE sets the slot format per slot over a first number of slots as indicated by pattern1 and the UE sets the slot format per slot over a second number of slots as indicated by pattern2. The pattern2 provides - a slot configuration period of msec by dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity - a number of slots with only downlink symbols by nrofDownlinkSlots - a number of downlink symbols by nrofDownlinkSymbols - a number of slots with only uplink symbols by nrofUplinkSlots - a number of uplink symbols by nrofUplinkSymbols The applicable values of are same as the applicable values for . A slot configuration period of msec includes first slots and second slots. From the slots, a first slots include only downlink symbols and a last include only uplink symbols. The symbols after the first slots are downlink symbols. The symbols before the last slots are uplink symbols. The remaining are flexible symbols. A UE expects that divides 20 msec. The first symbol every periods is a first symbol in an even frame. A UE expects that the reference SCS configuration is smaller than or equal to a SCS configuration for any configured DL BWP or UL BWP. Each slot provided by pattern1 or pattern2 is applicable to consecutive slots in the active DL BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot for the reference SCS configuration and each downlink or flexible or uplink symbol for the reference SCS configuration corresponds to consecutive downlink or flexible or uplink symbols for the SCS configuration . A downlink or flexible symbol provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon can include an UL sub-band provided by ul-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth, a first DL sub-band provided by firstDL-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth and may additionally include a second DL sub-band provided by secondDL-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth, for a SCS configuration of any configured UL BWP or DL BWP, respectively, as provided by scs-SpecificCarrierList [4, TS 38.211]. The downlink or flexible symbol is then referred to as an SBFD symbol; otherwise, it is referred to as a non-SBFD symbol. Unless otherwise stated, the UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink and as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon to be available for transmissions. Uplink symbols by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon are non-SBFD symbols. An SBFD symbol or a non-SBFD symbol provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon cannot change to a non-SBFD symbol or to an SBFD symbol, respectively, by other information. The UE is not provided coresetPoolIndex and is not configured to receive PDSCH according to more than one TCI states mapped to one TCI codepoint [6, TS 38.214] for a serving cell where the UE is provided SBFD symbols. For a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission in flexible symbols indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and associated with PRACH transmission in first PRACH occasions, the UE assumes the flexible symbols as non-SBFD symbols in this RACH attempt. The frequency location of an UL sub-band, or a first DL sub-band, or a second DL sub-band, starts at RB and includes a number of contiguous RBs provided by ul-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth, or firstDL-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth or secondDL-SubbandlocationAndBandwidth, respectively, that indicates an offset and a length as RIV according to [6, TS 38.214], setting , and a value provided by offsetToCarrier for the subcarrierSpacing. SBFD symbols are consecutive, start from a first slot provided by SBFD-StartingSlotIndex and from a first symbol in the first slot provided by SBFD-StartingSymbolIndex, and end in a second slot provided by SBFD-EndingSlotIndex and in a second symbol in the second slot provided by SBFD-EndingSymbolIndex. SBFD symbols can be provided in any of pattern1 and, if provided, pattern2. A configuration period for SBFD symbols is msec when only pattern1 is provided, or when pattern2 is additionally provided. Except for a PRACH transmission in a PRACH occasion determined based on a second RACH configuration provided by sbfd-RACHDualConfig as described in clause 8, the UE transmits or receives a physical channel or signal either only in SBFD symbols or only in non-SBFD symbols. For a PUCCH transmission with SP-CSI reports, or for a PUCCH with SR, LRR, UEIRI, UE doesn’t transmit the PUCCH transmission occasion that is mapped to SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols. When the UE is provided sbfd-Config2-Transmission, the UE can - transmit a first PUCCH or PUSCH or a first repetition of a PUCCH or PUSCH in non-SBFD symbols, and - transmit a second PUCCH or PUSCH or a second repetition of the PUCCH or PUSCH, in SBFD symbols When the UE is provided sbfd-Config2-Reception, the UE can - receive a first PDSCH or a first repetition of a PDSCH in non-SBFD symbols, and - receive a second PDSCH or a second repetition of the PDSCH in SBFD symbols When a UE is not provided sbfd-Config2-Transmission - for a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission with repetitions, if the first repetition is either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, the remaining repetitions are also either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, respectively - for a Type 2 CG PUSCH transmission, or for a PUSCH transmission with SP-CSI reports, if the first transmission after a latest activation is either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, the remaining transmissions associated with the latest activation are also either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, respectively - for a Type 1 CG PUSCH, or for a PUCCH transmission with SP-CSI reports, or for a PUCCH with SR, LRR, UEIRI, or P-CSI, or SRS, all respective transmissions are either only in SBFD symbols or only in non-SBFD symbols as indicated by the respective configurations [12, TS 38.331] When a UE is not provided sbfd-Config2-Reception, - for a PDSCH reception with repetitions, if the first repetition is either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, the remaining repetitions are also either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, respectively - for a SPS PDSCH reception, if the first reception after a latest activation is either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, the remaining receptions associated with the latest activation are also either in SBFD symbols or in non-SBFD symbols, respectively In an SBFD symbol, and except for cross-link interference measurements [6, TS 38.214], the UE transmits or receives only in RBs that are both in the active UL BWP and in the UL sub-band, or both in the active DL BWP and the DL sub-band(s), respectively. The UE does not transmit in SBFD symbols indicated for presence of SS/PBCH blocks within the active DL BWP by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or in ServingCellConfigCommon. If the UE is additionally provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the parameter tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated overrides only flexible symbols per slot over the number of slots as provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. The tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated provides - a set of slot configurations by slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList - for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations - a slot index for a slot provided by slotIndex - a set of symbols for a slot by symbols where - if symbols = allDownlink, all symbols in the slot are downlink - if symbols = allUplink, all symbols in the slot are uplink - if symbols = explicit, nrofDownlinkSymbols provides a number of downlink first symbols in the slot and nrofUplinkSymbols provides a number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If nrofDownlinkSymbols is not provided, there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if nrofUplinkSymbols is not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible For each slot having a corresponding index provided by slotIndex, the UE applies a format provided by a corresponding symbols. The UE does not expect tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to indicate as uplink or as downlink a symbol that tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon indicates as a downlink or as an uplink symbol, respectively. For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, the UE ignores symbols provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, if any. For each slot configuration provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, a reference SCS configuration is the reference SCS configuration provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon. A slot configuration period and a number of downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible symbols in each slot of the slot configuration period are determined from tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated and are common to each configured BWP. A UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to be available for receptions and considers symbols in a slot indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated to be available for transmissions. If a UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2_0, for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or when tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated are not provided to the UE - the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format - the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS, or a DL PRS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE receives the PDCCH, the PDSCH, the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS if the UE does not detect a DCI format that indicates to the UE to transmit a PUSCH, a PUCCH, a PRACH, or a SRS in at least one symbol of the set of symbols of the slot; otherwise, the UE does not receive the PDCCH, or the PDSCH, or the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot. For a UE operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or in FR2-2 when the UE is provided ChannelAccessMode2 = 'enabled', if the UE is provided csi-RS-ValidationWithDCI, is not provided CO-DurationsPerCell, and is not provided SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell, and if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot if the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating an aperiodic CSI-RS reception or scheduling a PDSCH reception in the set of symbols of the slot. If a UE is provided channelAccessMode ='dynamic' and is provided availableRB-SetsToAddModList and availableRB-SetsToReleaseList, the UE expects to be provided co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList and co-DurationsPerCellToReleaseList and/or slotFormatCombToAddModList and slotFormatCombToReleaseList. For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols, then - If the UE does not indicate the capability of partialCancellationPUCCH-PUSCH-PRACH-TX, the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in the set of symbols if the first symbol in the set occurs within relative to a last symbol of a PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in the set of symbols. - If the UE indicates the capability of partialCancellationPUCCH-PUSCH-PRACH-TX, the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within relative to a last symbol of a PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH [6, TS 38.214], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of [6, TS 38.214], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols. - The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols from the subset of symbols that occur within relative to a last symbol of a PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of symbols. is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE processing capability [6, TS 38.214] assuming and corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or , where corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15kHz or higher; otherwise . For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS when the PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot. For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, the UE does not receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, if the UE is not provided with a measurement gap. For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated and, when applicable, are indicated as non-SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS when the PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot. For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as flexible by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or are indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, the UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher layer parameters configuring transmission from the UE in the set of symbols of the slot and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring reception by the UE in the set of symbols of the slot. For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, for a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE for reception of SS/PBCH blocks by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or by ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon or as described in Clause 4.4 or, if the UE is not provided dl-OrJointTCI-StateList, by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI associated to physical cell ID with active TCI states for PDCCH or PDSCH, or for a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to SS/PBCH blocks configured for L1 beam measurement/reporting, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH in the slot if a transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols and the UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot. The UE does not expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated, when provided to the UE. < Unchanged Text Omitted > |

> Adopt the following TP to Clause 5.1 and 6.1, TS 38.214
> | Reason for change: | In the legacy, for multi-PUSCH scheduled by a single DCI and multi-PUSCH configured grant, PUSCH(s) not transmitted due to collision with legacy DL symbols indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated or SSB symbols is not assigned with an HARQ process ID. However, if SBFD subbands is configured in legacy DL symbols, PUSCH transmission occasions in the SBFD-DL symbols should be valid and assigned with an HARQ process ID. In addition, PUSCH transmission occasion colliding with symbol(s) that is not the valid symbol type or across two symbol types should be invalid and not assigned with an HARQ process ID. For multi-PDSCH scheduled by a single DCI, PDSCH(s) not received due to collision with legacy UL symbols indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated is not assigned with an HARQ process ID. However, with introduction of SBFD, PDSCH reception occasion colliding with symbol(s) that is not the valid symbol type or across two symbol types should be invalid and not assigned with an HARQ process ID. |
> |  |  |
> | Summary of change: | Clarify UE behavior for HARQ process ID determination for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH |
> |  |  |
> | Consequences if not approved: | PUSCH transmissions in SBFD-DL symbols cannot be assigned corresponding HARQ process IDs. PDSCH receptions colliding with symbol(s) that is not the valid symbol type or across two symbol types are unnecessary consuming HARQ process ID. |
> |  |  |
> | 5 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures 5.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel <<omitted text>> A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1_0, 1_1, 1_2, 1_3, 4_0, 4_1, or 4_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI. When the UE is scheduled with multiple PDSCHs on a serving cell by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PDSCH not overlapping with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, if applicable, not overlapping with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type and not across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 5.1.2.1a., HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PDSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH-v1700 applied if or nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH-v1700 is provided, or with modulo operation of 8 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for PDSCH(s) not received if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, or, if applicable, the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlap with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type or include SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 5.1.2.1a. When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter repetitionScheme set to 'tdmSchemeA', the PDSCH includes two PDSCH transmission occasions. For each PDSCH, if either PDSCH occasion overlaps with a UL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, the PDSCH is not received and HARQ process ID is not increment for the PDSCH. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH if the UE is not capable of receiving FDMed unicast and multicast PDSCH per slot per carrier. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is not disabled, or for the HARQ process associated with the first SPS PDSCH when HARQ-feedbackEnablingforSPSactive is provided and enabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of [6, TS 38.213]. For HARQ-ACK subject to HARQ-ACK deferral described in Clause 9.2.5.4 of [6 TS 38.213], the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK corresponds to the expected transmission HARQ-ACK in a first slot. When HARQ feedback for the HARQ process ID is disabled, the UE is not expected to receive another PDCCH carrying a DCI scheduling a PDSCH or set of slot-aggregated PDSCH scheduled for the given HARQ process or to receive another PDSCH without corresponding PDCCH for the given HARQ process that starts until Tproc,1 after the end of the reception of the last PDSCH or slot-aggregated PDSCH for that HARQ process. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoolIndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex and the UE reports its capability of outOfOrderOperationDL-r16, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK transmissions, each slot is composed of symbols [4] or a number of symbols indicated by subslotLengthForPUCCH if provided, and the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook of the same priority. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoolIndex in ControlResourceSet and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex and the UE reports its capability of outOfOrderOperationDL-r16, in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of a scheduling cell,. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], the PDCCH ending in symbol i is determined based on the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI, the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH with a starting symbol less than N symbols after the last symbol of that PDSCH, where the value of N depends on the PDSCH subcarrier spacing configuration , with N=13 for =0, N=13 for =1, N=20 for =2, N=24 for =3, N=96 for =5, and N=192 for =6. <<omitted text>> 6 Physical uplink shared channel related procedure 6.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical uplink shared channel <<omitted text>> When the UE is configured dl-OrJointTCI-StateList or ul-TCI-StateList, the UE shall perform PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or a Type 2 configured grant or a dynamic grant according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS for determining UL Tx spatial filter. The RS is determined based on an RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' of the indicated TCI-State or an RS in the indicated TCI-UL-State. The reference RS in the indicated TCI-State can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, or a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info. The reference RS in the indicated TCI-UL-State can be a CSI-RS resource in a NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter repetition, a CSI-RS resource in an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet configured with higher layer parameter trs-Info, an SRS resource in an SRS resource set with the higher layer parameter usage set to 'beamManagement', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell. When nrofSlotsInCG-Period is configured for Type 1 configured grant or Type 2 configured grant, HARQ process ID for the first configured PUSCH grant and each subsequent valid configured PUSCH grant within a periodicity of the configuration is determined as in clause 5.4.1 of [10, TS 38.321], where a valid configured PUSCH grant is the one not colliding with the DL symbol(s) indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and not colliding with a symbol(s) of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst as described in clause 11.1 of [6, TS 38.213] and, if applicable, not colliding with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type and not across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a. <<omitted text>> When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs on a serving cell by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, or, if applicable, a symbol that is not the valid symbol type and not across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a., HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, or, if applicable, the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlap with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type or include SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoolIndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex and the UE reports its capability of outOfOrderOperationUL-r16 or outOfOrderOperationUL-r18, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0_0, 0_1, 0_2 or 0_3 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. <<omitted text>> | 5 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures 5.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel <<omitted text>> A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1_0, 1_1, 1_2, 1_3, 4_0, 4_1, or 4_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI.

When nrofSlotsInCG-Period is configured for Type 1 configured grant or Type 2 configured grant, HARQ process ID for the first configured PUSCH grant and each subsequent valid configured PUSCH grant within a periodicity of the configuration is determined as in clause 5.4.1 of [10, TS 38.321], where a valid configured PUSCH grant is the one not colliding with the DL symbol(s) indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, and not colliding with a symbol(s) of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst as described in clause 11.1 of [6, TS 38.213] and, if applicable, not colliding with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type and not across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a. <<omitted text>> When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs on a serving cell by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies to the first PUSCH not overlapping with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, or, if applicable, a symbol that is not the valid symbol type and not across SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a., HARQ process ID is then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled order, with modulo operation of nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH applied if nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPUSCH is provided, or with modulo operation of 16 applied, otherwise. HARQ process ID is not incremented for PUSCH(s) not transmitted if at least one of the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlaps with a DL symbol indicated by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated if provided, and, when applicable, not indicated as SBFD by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, or a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with index provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst, or, if applicable, the symbols indicated by the indexed row of the used resource allocation table in the slot overlap with a symbol that is not the valid symbol type or include SBFD symbols and non-SBFD symbols according to clause 6.1.2.1a. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that contains two different values of coresetPoolIndex in ControlResourceSet for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two PUSCHs are associated to different ControlResourceSets having different values of coresetPoolIndex and the UE reports its capability of outOfOrderOperationUL-r16 or outOfOrderOperationUL-r18, for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol j by a PDCCH ending in symbol i on a scheduling cell,, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a PDCCH that ends later than symbol i of the scheduling cell. When the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets, as described in clause 10.1 of [6, TS 38.213], for the purpose of determining the PDCCH ending in symbol i, the PDCCH candidate that ends later in time is used. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0_0, 0_1, 0_2 or 0_3 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ process with the DCI received before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI. <<omitted text>> |

> Adopt the following TP to TS38.214 Section 5.2.1.5.2
> | Reason for change The application timeline of activation/deactivation of SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM resources based on the newly specified MAC CE for LTM, SP CSI-RS/CSI-IM Resource Set Activation/Deactivation for Candidate Cell MAC CE, is missing from TS 38.214.

> On the measurement aspects (e.g., metric) for A-IoT device localization, capture the following observations in TR 38.769.
> ---
> Regarding the D2R RSRP-like measurement for A-IoT device localization, following observations were provided during the study.
> - [FUTUREWEI] Use NR measurements (SL PRS-RSRP and UL-SRS-RSRP) as a reference. For D2R RSRP-like measurement, the reader can use the D2R preamble for the reference signal and measure the power between the end of R2D transmission and start of the D2R transmission to estimate the noise and interference. To estimate proximity, a reader can also consider the effects of propagation delay based on when the D2R transmission is received.
> - [Huawei] D2R RSRP-like measurement is defined as the time domain linear average over the power contributions (in [W]) of preamble and midamble signals within the signal transmission bandwidth during the D2R transmission.
> - [Ericsson] D2R-amble-RSRP is defined as the linear average over the power contributions (in [W]) of chips that carry the D2R preamble over PDRCH. A secondary measurement can be defined as the linear averaging over the power contributions of chips that carry D2R preamble and D2R midambles over PDRCH.
> - [CATT] The definition of RSRP-like and AOA measurement quantity can refer to TR 38.215(NR; Physical layer measurements).
> - [Xiaomi] The RSRP-like definition in A-IoT is the linear average of the received power in occupied chips and over the frequency resources that carry the measured signal. For example, if D2R is applied with OOK modulation, referring to the definition of LP-RSRP where measured signal is also an OOK waveform, RSRP-like definition in A-IoT is the linear average of the received power in OOK ON chips over the frequency resources that carry the measured signal.
> - [Qualcomm] At reader side, how to measure the RSRP may be up to reader implementation. However, it may require the averaging of the D2R measurements based on D2R signals/channels with sufficient time duration and stable transmit power from device side.
> - [NEC] D2R RSRP based measurement and positioning is feasible. R20 AIoT should support D2R RSRP based measurement.

A UE can assume that the PDSCH signals for layers would have the same ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE for all CSI-RS resources , equal to the powerControlOffset of the respective CSI-RS resource. - a UE configured with one or more SRS resource sets with higher layer parameter usage set to 'antennaSwitching', with a total of or 8 ports across the resources intended for xT6R or xT8R, respectively, if the higher layer parameter reportQuantity in CSI-ReportConfig for which the CQI is reported is set to 'cri-RI-CQI' and the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter SRSPortGrouping-r19, the UE can assume that SRS port group 0 corresponds to codeword 0 and comprises the even ports, and that SRS port group 1 corresponds to codeword 1 and comprises the odd ports out of the total ports. The SRS ports are indexed in an ascending order according to SRS resource ID and port number within each SRS resource, for one SRS resource set, or according to SRS resource set ID, SRS resource ID in a set and port number within each SRS resource, for multiple aperiodic SRS resource sets. - that contains a list of sub-configurations provided by csi-ReportSubConfigToAddModList, - If a sub-configuration indicates a CSI-RS antenna port subset using the higher layer bitmap parameter portSubsetIndicator or portSubsetIndicator-r19, as described in clause 5.2.1.4.2, for CQI calculation, antenna ports corresponding to all bits with value of 1 in portSubsetIndicator are mapped to consecutive antenna ports starting at CSI-RS antenna port 3000 in increasing order of the bit position in portSubsetIndicator. The UE should assume that PDSCH signals on antenna ports in the set [1000,…, 1000+ν-1] for ν layers would result in signals equivalent to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports [3000, …, 3000+P-1] T, as given by where P corresponds to the number of bits with value 1 in the bitmap portSubsetIndicator and T , and are as previously described in this Clause, and the corresponding PDSCH EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE is as previously defined in this Clause if the sub-configuration does not indicate a power offset powerOffset. - If a sub-configuration indicates a list of NZP CSI-RS resources, provided by nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceList and does not indicate a power offset powerOffset, for CQI calculation for the sub-configuration the UE follows the procedure previously described in this Clause. - If a sub-configuration indicates a power offset powerOffset, for CQI calculation, the UE shall assume the corresponding PDSCH signals transmitted on the antenna ports of a CSI-RS resource would have a ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE equal to the difference between powerControlOffset of the CSI-RS resource, given in Clause 5.2.2.3.1, and powerOffset, where the difference is expected to take one of the values that can be configured for powerControlOffset of the CSI-RS resource, given in Clause 5.2.2.3.1, and is also expected to take a value that is no larger than the value of powerControlOffset. < Unchanged parts are omitted > |

> - Draft LS R1-2507925 is endorsed in principle.
> - Adopt the following TP for TS38.214 Section 5.2.4a and TS 38.212, section 6.3.1.2.1
> - Note: No dedicated issue to support early CSI acquisition for L3 handover to be discussed in RAN1 before RAN#111.
> | 1. Overall Description RAN1 thanks RAN2 for the LS R1-2506717 (R2-2506504) on early CSI acquisition for L3 handover. From RAN1 perspective, there is no problem to support early CSI acquisition for L3 by re-using the early CSI acquisition framework for LTM. On the configuration of channel measurement and interference measurement resources in RAN2 RRC CR (R2-2506450), RAN1 suggest to directly use NZP CSI RS resource set and CSI-IM resource set and suggest the following changes on EarlyCSI-Acquisition-r19. EarlyCSI-Acquisition-r19 ::= SEQUENCE { early-NZP-CSI-RS-Resource-r19 NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId, early-CSI-IM-Resource-r19 CSI-IM-ResourceId OPTIONAL, -- Need R reportQuantity-r19 ENUMERATED {cri-RI-PMI-CQI, spare}, cqi-Table-r19 ENUMERATED {table1, table2, table3, table4-r17}, codebookConfig-EarlyCSI-r19 CodeBookConfig-EarlyCSI-r19 } 2. Actions To RAN2 ACTION: RAN1 respectfully asks RAN2 to take the above information into account. |
> | 5.2.4a CSI Reporting for LTM A UE configured with LTM-Config can be provided configurations for CSI acquisition, by up to one Reporting Setting, ltm-CSI-ReportConfig, for a candidate cell. Each Reporting Setting ltm-CSI-ReportConfig is associated with either one or two Resource Settings When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement) is configured, it provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for both channel and interference measurements. The UE is not expected to be configured with more than 128 NZP CSI-RS ports in the CSI-RS resource set contained within the Resource Setting. When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement) provides a list of NZP CSI-RS resources for channel measurement, and the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourceForInterferenceMeasurements), provides a list of [CSI-IM resources] for interference measurement. The UE is not expected to be configured with more than 128 NZP CSI-RS ports in the CSI-RS resource set contained within the Resource Setting. The Resource Setting given by higher layer parameter ltm-ResourcesForChannelMeasurement, LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig, contains configuration of a ltm-NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet which comprises of a list of Z ≥ 1 NZP CSI-RS resource indices (given by ltm-CSI-RS-ResourceList) and a list of Z LTM-CandidateIds (given by ltm-CandidateIdList) referring to candidate cells associated with the NZP CSI-RS resource indices. For CSI acquisition associated with a Reporting Setting, ltm-CSI-ReportConfig, the UE is expected to measure the NZP-CSI-RS resources in ltm-CSI-RS-ResourceList associated with the LTM-CandidateId that is equal to the LTM-CandidateId of the LTM-Candidate under which the Reporting Setting is configured. The UE shall expect the following configuration provided by ltm-CSI-ReportConfig: - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the CQI format indicator is Wideband CQI. - For the frequency granularity of the CSI report, the PMI format indicator is Wideband PMI. - The codebook type is typeI-SinglePanel. - The reportQuantity is set to ‘cri-RI-PMI-CQI’. After a UE receives an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, TS 38.321] providing a candidate cell (given by Target Configuration ID field), and a ltm-CSI-ReportConfig is configured for the candidate cell, the UE can measure corresponding NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources if configured, and shall transmit a CSI report to the candidate cell. For RACH-less LTM cell switch [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant [6, TS 38.213]. For RACH-based LTM cell switch using a contention-free random access procedure [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the PUSCH scheduled by the RAR UL grant or MsgA PUSCH. For RACH-based LTM cell switch using a contention-based random access procedure [23, TS 38.300], the UE shall transmit the CSI report to the candidate cell using the first PUSCH corresponding to a dynamic grant or a configured grant after the HARQ-ACK transmission corresponding to Msg4 or MsgB. If a valid CSI is not available, the UE shall transmit a CSI report which contains a CQI corresponding to the lowest CQI index. Depending on the UE capability, the UE may measure NZP CSI-RS resources and CSI-IM resources if configured corresponding to a ltm-CSI-ReportConfig before receiving the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE [10, TS 38.321]. |
> | 6.3.2.1.2 CSI If cqi-BitsPerSubband is configured, this Clause 6.3.2.1.2 applies by taking Subband CQI as Subband differential CQI and replacing the corresponding number of bits 2 by 4. <Unchanged part omitted> The mapping order of CSI fields of one report for CSI reporting for L1/L2-triggered mobility as defined in Clause 5.2.4a of [6, TS 38.214] is provided in Table 6.3.1.1.2-7 by taking only Tables 6.3.1.1.2-1/3 for the determination of the bitwidth of a CSI field.
